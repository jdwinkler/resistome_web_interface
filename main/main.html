<p><b>About the Resistome:</b><br><br>
The Resistome contains standardized representation of <i>E. coli</i> mutants resisting 460 types of inhibition (solvents, environmental stresses, antibiotics, and many others). This website is meant to help users search the Resistome to find genotypes and phenotypes that may be of interest for their work. For more information about the Resistome and its associated software tools, please take a look at our publications <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00150">here</a> and <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00235">here</a>.
